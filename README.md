&#9989;Tapping on Home, Search, Account, or Trending should show the respective screen and highlight the tab bar button.
<br>&#9989;Compose button should modally present the compose screen.
<br>&#9989;Optional: Compose screen is faded in while the buttons animate in.
<br>&#10006;&nbsp;Optional: Login button should show animate the login form over the view controller.
<br>&#9989;Optional: Discover bubble should bob up and down unless the SearchViewController is tapped.
<br><br>
<b>Notes:</b>
<br>Felt mostly comfortable with this overallâ€”will definitely take practice. Had some issues with the Animate-out for the compose screen. "Hacked" it to work by performing a move (with delay) after the screen is dismissed
